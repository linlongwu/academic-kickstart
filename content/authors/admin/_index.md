Linlong Wu was born in Chizhou, Anhui. He received the B.Eng. degree with Honours in Information Engineering from the Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU) in 2014, and the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2018. His PhD research interests include optimization algorithms and data analytics with applications on radar waveform design, array signal processing and financial engineering.

Currently, he is an engineer/researcher in the networking research team of the Alibaba Infrastructure Service (AIS) of Alibaba, which he joined in November, 2018. His current research interests include wireless sensing and IoT using tools from optimization theory, array signal processing and data analytics. He is currently working on the design and build of a commercial intelligent localization system with applications on unmanned retails and intelligent logistics.
